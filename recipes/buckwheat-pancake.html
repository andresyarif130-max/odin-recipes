        <p>These buckwheat pancakes came about for a few reasons: I get lots of requests for anything breakfast, I'm trying to cook with more whole grains, and I heard someone say it's almost impossible to make a great pancake using 100% buckwheat flour.</p>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Whisk buckwheat flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a medium bowl.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Beat buttermilk, egg, and vanilla together in a large bowl.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Pour flour mixture into buttermilk mixture; whisk until batter is thick and smooth. Let batter rest until bubbles form and batter relaxes, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Melt butter on a griddle over medium heat. Drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the hot griddle and cook until bubbles form and the edges dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.</li>
